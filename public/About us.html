                               <br>
                               <p>Arul's Energy& Environment Pvt Limited, henceforth AEEPL, has identified MPM Technologies, Inc. as a target company for acquisition.</p>
                               <br>
                               <p>MPM is a publicly traded company under the symbol MPML in the United States. It was originally founded as a mining business in 1983 but has since diversified into the renewable energy and environmental sustainability industries. In 1986, the company formed Nupower, Inc.
                                 specializing in waste gasification technologies and in 1998 through the acquisition of AirPol, Inc. entered the air pollution control sector.</p>
                               <br>
                               <p>Between 1999 and 2001, MPM enjoyed its peak years with annual business volume reaching as much as $20 million fueled by strong management and substantial international growth. 
                                Though in the years following, MPM's business began to recede due to a shortage of opportunities for mining, gasification and the weakening of the market for AirPol's products and services.</p>
                               <br>
                               <p>However, in the last two years, the market potential and opportunities for all of MPM's business units have drastically increased due to the worldwide movement towards green energy and the reduction of carbon emissions, all of which are encompassed by MPM's core competencies. 
                                Furthermore, MPM mining stands to greatly benefit from the ever-rising price of gold and silver given its substantial reserve holdings.
                                 Unfortunately, MPM has not been in a position to reap the benefits from the sudden surge in these business opportunities, simply due to its lack of financial resources. 
                                In view of these highly favorable circumstances, MPM predicts that with the proper capital infusion, its business will grow exponentially in the coming years.</p>

                           <br>
                           <p>AArul's Energy & Environment Pvt Limited (AEEPL) is a proprietary company looking to provide services in the fields of environmental sustainability and renewable energy. The company was registered in India on 20.12.2006.   </p>
                           <br>
                           <p>The founder of this company, Dr. S. Arulrhaj, has a long history of successfully providing medical services in India. He is the former president of the Indian Medical Association, and is currently the President of the Commonwealth Medical Association in London.</p>
                           <br>
                           <p>Dr. Arulrhaj's personal interest in environmental services and his commitment to improving the world's environmental and energy picture grew out of his own medical background.</p>
                           <br>
                           <p>Dr. Arulrhaj runs a 100-bed hospital and is therefore responsible for the safe disposal of hospital waste. Based on his long time experience dealing with clinical waste, Dr. Arulrhaj believes that the correct way to dispose of waste is not just to destroy it, but to convert it into useful energy. He also firmly believes this Waste-to-Energy business will become the fastest growing business in the immediate future. </p>
                           <br>
                           <p>To date the company has been evaluating environmental and green energy technologies and products. These range from lifestyle products from Singapore, which provide clean drinking water, to waste- toenergy systems via waste gasification technologies from the US.</p>
                           <br>
                           <p>After spending a great deal of time looking at the opportunities to enter the waste to power and liquid fuel market, he concluded that the best approach to enter this market is via acquisition. </p>

                                <li>a. There are at least 50 companies in the world that claim they possess such technology, but no more than a dozen have truly built a unit with their technology.</li>
                                <br><li>b. The few that have successfully commercialized their technologies, i.e. with commercial units in operation, are simply "untouchable", i.e. either unwilling to entertain the acquisition or demanding a ridiculously high sell price.</li>
                                <br><li>c. The products from these companies have been found to be very intensive in both capital and operating costs. It is doubtful whether their technologies make economic sense.</li>

                            <h4>The MPM acquisition opportunity appeared to be extremely attractive based on the following merits :</h4>
                        </a>
                        <div class="text">
                            <br>

                                <li>a. The Skygas electro-kinetic gasification technology is unique in that instead of relying on extremely high temperatures for waste decomposition, it undergoes a series of "free radical chain 4 reaction" to decompose the waste. This process provides for the total gasification of the carbonaceous wastes at a much lower level of energy consumption than its competition.</li>
                                <br><li>b. The technology is nearing full commercialization - A commercial scale Skygas plant was built and tested in 1992 - 1993 period. The technology has been proven viable.</li>
                                <br><li>c. Other valuable assets - Along with Skygas gasification technology AEGOPL will acquire both AirPol, Inc., a company specialized in air pollution control and syngas cleaning, and MPM Mining, Inc., a mining company with considerable mining assets.</li>
                                <br><li>d. An excellent management team that understands the value of MPM can only be realized and multiplied via the proper infusion of resources. </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Since the initial contact made in October of 2009, the discussion with MPM Management has been progressing steadily and smoothly. A binding MOU was signed on December 25, 2009, recently amended on March 10, 2010 with the final closing scheduled for Sept 2011.</p>
